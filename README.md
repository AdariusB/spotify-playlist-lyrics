# Spotify Playlist Lyric project

## Goal

To create an application that can find the most common lyrics from a Spotify playlist. Using Node.js backend with future plans to utilize either a React or Angular frontend to display the results.

## Tools being used

[musixmatch](https://coda.io/@musixmatch/musixmatch-lyrics-api) Lyrics API: Retrieve lyrics from each song. **Note:** Due to being an individual developer I am not granted the ability to get 100% of the lyrics, only 30%.
[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/): To read playlists and get song information.

## Notes

A previous attempt was made to webscrape lyric sites but that since has been abandoned. Necessary code is currently stored in the spotify-api folder but webscraping files are available in the case we decide to revisit.
